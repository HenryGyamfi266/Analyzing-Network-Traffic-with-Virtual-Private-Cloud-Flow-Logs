# Analyzing-Network-Traffic-with-Virtual-Private-Cloud-Flow-Logs

## Overview
In this project, I configure a network to record traffic to and from an Apache web server using VPC Flow Logs. I will then export the logs to BigQuery for analysis.
VPC Flow Logs can be used to determine where applications are being accessed from to optimize network traffic expense, to create HTTP Load Balancers to balance traffic globally,
or to denylist unwanted IP addresses with Cloud Armor.

## Objectives
In this project, I do the following:
Configure a custom network with VPC Flow Logs.
Create an Apache web server.
Verify that network traffic is logged.
Export the network traffic to BigQuery to further analyze the logs.
Setup VPC flow log aggregation.
